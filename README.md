# Household-Energy-Consumption-Forecasting-Power-BI-Python

## Project Overview
Created a forecasting dashboard using Household Electric Power Consumption time-series data, integrating Python (Facebook Prophet) directly into Power BI.

## Dashboard Elements
1. Forecasting Overview – KPIs, forecast next 12 months, actual vs. forecast chart with confidence intervals.  
2. Error & Accuracy Analysis – MAPE trends, rolling MAPE, forecast error by month.  
3. Seasonality Insights – Monthly & weekday patterns, daily consumption profiles.
